# B2W2 Scripting

A script decompiler (and, eventually, compiler) for Pokemon Black 2 and White 2.

## Features

* Decompiles all scripts in a script file's header
* Supports command arguments
* Much more to come - for more info, see the sample .txt in this repo's root

## Remarks

This isn't meant for use in real projects. I'm really just learning to use C# and manage a growing program, so a lot of the code is ugly beginner code.

It doesn't have many real features yet, and the summer's ending quickly, so I decided open sourcing it would be good despite not having the features I was hoping for ready.

If I get everything about the parser and compiler done, I'll try making a proper editor GUI out of Windows Forms or Gtk#.

I haven't tested this in Mono at all, but any builds that get released will be tested on Mono on Linux Mint.
