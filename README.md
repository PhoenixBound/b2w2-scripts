# B2W2 Scripting

A script decompiler (and, eventually, compiler) for Pokemon Black 2 and White 2.

## Features

* Decompiles all scripts in a script file's header
* Supports command arguments
* Much more to come - for more info, see the sample .txt in this repo's root

## Remarks

This isn't meant for use in real projects. I'm really just learning to use C# and manage a growing program, so a lot of the code is ugly beginner code.

I want to keep making the code pretty right now, so right now it is **not under a license**. It won't always be like that, though - I just want to implement more features and sort everything out first before anyone touches this.

If I get everything about the parser and compiler done, I'll try making a proper editor GUI out of Windows Forms or Gtk#.

I haven't tested this in Mono at all, but any builds that get released will be tested on Mono on Linux Mint.
